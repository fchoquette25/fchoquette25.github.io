Can I clearly track the development of my website through my commits?
Nevertheless, I think so but I am still getting the hang of it. Nevertheless, I think that GitHub is hard to use so I am going to try my best to continue working through any difficulties that may arise.

How effectively do the commit messages communicate what I was doing?
II think they were effective but I dont think they were crystal clear.

How might I embed this process, or something similar in other places of my life?
I could use this as a tool for problem solving and careful reading. This also requires me to have a lot of organization which can help me in many other aspects of my life.
