Can I clearly track the development of my website through my commits?
I think so but I am still getting the hang of it.

How effectively do the commit messages communicate what I was doing?
I think they were effective but I dont think they were crystal clear.

How might I embed this process, or something similar in other places of my life?
I could use this as a tool for problem solving and careful reading.
